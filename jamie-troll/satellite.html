        <h1>"Satellite"</h1>
        <h2>Guster</h2>
            <p>Shining like a work of art<br>Hanging on a wall of stars<br>Are you what I think you are?</p>
            <p>You're my satellite<br>You're riding with me tonight<br>Passenger side, lighting the sky<br>Always the first star that I find<br>You're my satellite<br></p>
            <p>Elevator to the moon<br>Whistling our favorite tune<br>Trying to get a closer view<br></p>
            <p>You're my satellite<br>You're riding with me tonight<br>Passenger side, lighting the sky<br>Always the first star that I find<br>You're my satellite<br></p>
            <p>Maybe you will always be<br>Just a little out of reach<br></p>
            <p>You're my satellite<br>You're riding with me tonight<br>Passenger side, lighting the sky<br>Always the first star that I find<br>You're my satellite<br>You're my satellite<br></p>
